**pyvlog** is a Python package for working with traffic device data from smart intersections that adhere to the V-Log_
messaging protocol. It can be used to convert sequences of device messages into time-stamped statuses for any
combination of traffic devices at a smart intersection. UltraJSON_ provides fast writing of the status data to JSON
format.

See the README in the GitHub repo_ for usage examples.
